Five bullet points of what I accomplished last week 📅:

- 🐛 Fixed a bug where the server ignored `n_predict` values of `-2` when context wasn't filled, improving API behavior.  
- 🚀 Added support for the EXAONE model's tied word embeddings, enhancing model compatibility.  
- 📝 Updated documentation for function calling templates, making it easier to use with newer models.  
- 🛠️ Improved performance in the web UI by preventing unnecessary rerenders when typing in textareas.  
- 🔄 Collaborated with the community to refine the batch API and ensure better integration with various applications.
